menu
rgb(238 228 207)

main color:
rgb(230 223 205)

remove width &a height from main pic
create class for the img
put width 100% so it scales for responsive

consider splitting image & putting article in middle


@media (min-width: 600px)
main {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    background-color: rgb(230 223 205);
    padding: 20%;
}

ensure all images keep proportion but you can cut/clip images

===

for space between flex elements
use row-gap: 10px; thats between rows,
same for columns is there

if possible use background image where possible

unify all CSS files

only keep specific style in the sheet for that specific page, if you really want to keep it separate

but move whatever is needed in one style sheet in one
